    "\n",
    "* Given any point $p$ on a curve, you can choose points ever closer to it (on the left and the right) such that they approach $p$; they're at an *infinitesimal distance* from $p$\n",
    "* The limit of the function $f$ at $p$ is the value of $f$ at $p$; as you approach $p$, this value is the limit\n",
    "* For a function $f$, $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to a} f(x) = L$\n",
    "    * Values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily close to $L$ by requiring that $x$ be sufficiently close to, but not equal to, $a$\n",
    "* For simple examples, it's easy. For $f(x) = 2X + 3$, the limit as $x$ approaches $3$ is $9$.\n",
    "* For others, it's harder. for $f(x) = {{x^2}\\over{1 - x}}$, there is no value of $y$ for this function when $x = 1$. \n",
    "    * As $x$ tends towards $1$ from the left, the value of the function tends towards positive infinity; as the denominator gets smaller and smaller, and the numerator gets closer and closer to $1$, the ratio between them becomes infinitely large. \n",
    "    * Similarly, as $x$ approaches one from the right, the denominator tends closer towards an infinitely small *negative* number (because $x > 1$), and so the result of the function tends towards negative infinity.\n",
    "* So, for the first example we say that $f(x)$ was a 2-sided limit: as you approach the value from left or right, the value of the function tends towards the same value. \n",
    "    * The second example has both left hand and right hand limits, and they're different: ; ie. as you approach from these directions, they tend towards a different number.\n",
    "    * Right hand limit: $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = L$ - ie. we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we like by choosing  $x\\to{a}$ but greater than $a$. \n",
    "    * Left hand limit: $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = L$ - ie. we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we like by choosing $x\\to{a}$ but less than $a$.\n",
    "* You only get a two-sided limit if both limits exist, and are equal.\n",
    "* If the limit from either side is different, then the limit itself does not exist.\n",
    "* In python, you can use `SymPy.limit()` to calculate limits.\n",

    "If the limit of $f(x)$ as $x \\to a$ is $L$, then what we're saying is that if the distance between $x$ and $a$ is non-zero but smaller than some value, then the distance between $f(x)$ and $L$ will also be non-zero and smaller than some other value determined by $f(a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first distance ($x$ to $a$) is $\\delta$, and the second ($f(x)$ to $L$) is $\\epsilon$, then the formal definition of a limit is:\n",
    "\n",
    "For all $\\delta > 0$ there exists an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "if $|x - a| < \\delta$, then $|f(x) - L| < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proof of a formal limit\n",
    "\n",
    "The crux of this proof is that if we can define $\\delta$ in terms of $\\epsilon$ such that you can calculate $\\delta$ for all possible values of $\\epsilon$, then job jobbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "so, if we're looking at $f(x) = 5x + 2$, and we want to prove that $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 3} f(x) = 17$, or \n",
    "\n",
    "$$|x - 3| < \\delta \\Longleftrightarrow |f(x) - 17| < \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "First we rephrase the $\\epsilon$ inequality so that we can see how $\\epsilon$ relates to $\\delta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|f(x) - 17| < \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "$|5x + 2 - 17| < \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "$|5x - 15| < \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "$5|x - 3| < \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "$|x - 3| < { \\epsilon \\over 5} $\n",
    "\n",
    "We use that value as our value for $\\delta$.  So, the proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\epsilon > 0$ is given.  \n",
    "* We choose $\\delta = {\\epsilon \\over 5}$\n",
    "* Assume the first part of our limit is correct: $|x - 3| < \\delta$\n",
    "* Now:\n",
    "$|f(x) - 17| < \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "$|5x + 2 - 17| < \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "$|5x - 15| < \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "$5|x - 3| < \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $|x - 3| < \\delta$ (our assumption above), then \n",
    "\n",
    "$5|x - 3| < 5 \\cdot { \\epsilon \\over 5 }$\n",
    "\n",
    "$5|x - 3| < \\epsilon $ \n",
    "\n",
    "Which, if you look at our manipulations of $\\epsilon$ above, is the same as\n",
    "\n",
    "$|f(x) - 17| < \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "...which is what we trying to prove. So, if you want $f(x)$ to be within $\\epsilon$ of $L$, select values of $x$ within ${\\epsilon \\over 5}$ of $a$.\n",
