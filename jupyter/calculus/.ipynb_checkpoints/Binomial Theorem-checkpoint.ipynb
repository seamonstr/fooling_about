    "# The Binomial Theorem - raising binomials to powers\n",
    "\n",
    "$(a+b)^2 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$(a+b)^3 = (a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$(a+b)^4 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4)$\n",
    "\n",
    "So there's a pattern.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Portion of each term\n",
    "\n",
    "If $n$ is the power we're raising the binomial to, then for each subsequent term in the resulting polynomial, the exponent of $a$ starts at $n$ and goes down to $0$, while the exponent of $b$ starts at $0$ and climbs to $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for any $n$, you end up with a polynomial with $n + 1$ terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, zero-indexing the terms where $n$ is the power, and $k$ is the zero-based index of the term, each term's variable portion is:\n",
    "$$a^{n-k}b^{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "If we lay out all of the polynomials obtained by taking $a+b$ from power $0$ and up:\n",
    "$$1$$\n",
    "$$a+b$$\n",
    "$$a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$\n",
    "$$a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$$\n",
    "$$a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "...and then extract just the coefficients, we get\n",
    "$$1$$\n",
    "$$1 1$$\n",
    "$$1 2 1$$\n",
    "$$1 3 3 1$$\n",
    "$$1 4 6 4 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is pascal's triangle.  And, taking the row of that triangle whose zero-based index is equal to the power we're after, we get the correct coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "This triangle gives the correct values for the coefficient values for the given power and term index; it also gives you the correct results for ${n \\choose k}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're calculating a binomial to a power, it expands to a multiplication of binomials:\n",
    "$$(a+b)^3 = (a+b)(a+b)(a+b)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When you multiply binomials, you're saying \"every term in every binomial needs to be multiplied by every term in every other binomial\". To do this manually, you'd go through a systematic approach:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(a+b)(a+b)(a+b) \n",
    "= (a \\times a \\times a) + (a \\times a \\times b ) + (a \\times b \\times a) + (a \\times b \\times b) + ... + (b \\times b \\times b)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, all possible combinations of terms whose powers add up to $n$ will exist in our answer:\n",
    "- $a^3$\n",
    "- $a^2b$\n",
    "- $ab^2$\n",
    "- $b^3$\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of them will occur more than once.  We'll only get one $a^3$, but we'll get three $ab^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "S each term's coefficient is determined by how many times that combination arises in the full multiplying-out. So, let's say we decide to focus on the term $a$.  Given a set of three binomials, $(a+b)(a+b)(a+b)$, how many ways can we multiply them _without_ using $a$? The answer is one: $b \\times b \\times b = a^3$.  Similarly, how many combinations allow one $a$? Three - $abb$, $bab$ and $bba = 3ab^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives rise to the \"n choose k\" function: $n \\choose k$ - given a set of $n$ elements, how many combinations exist of $k$ of them?  For our problem, \"given a set of $n$ terms that all contain $a$, how many combinations will use no $a$s? How many one? ...and so on up to $n$, which is the power our binomial has been raised to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In an equation\n",
    "So, any expression of $(a+b)^n$ will give rise to a set of terms: each will be some combination of the variables where the powers add up to n, and the coefficient will be equal to $n \\choose k$, where $k$ is the power of any one of the variables:\n",
    "$${n \\choose k}(a^{n-k}b^k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The final answer will be the sum of all such terms, with $k$ starting at $0$ and ending at $n$:\n",
    "$$(a+b)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}{{n \\choose k}(a^{n-k}b^k)}$$"
