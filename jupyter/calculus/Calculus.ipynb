    "* Differential: \"derivative equation\" describes the rate of change of a function\n",
    "  * Find min or max value of a given function as part of an optimisation function\n",

    "  * Derivatives used to determine the instantaneous rate of change of a function\n",

    "* Functions that take a single input -> output\n",
    "* Function = rule that connects sets:\n",
    "    * A function is a relation from a set of inputs to a set of possible outputs, where each input is related to exactly one output\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Linear functions\n",
    "    * f(x) = mx + b => linear function\n",
    "    * Input val + output val = coordinate pair\n",
    "    * The function has variables and an input value\n",
    "    * The m-value in the linear function is the gradient; b is the y intercept (cuz with x == 0, m has no effect)\n",
    "        * If m > 1, gradient is positive\n",
    "    * Gradient is constant for all points on the line\n",
    "    * Given two points on a line, $T_1(x_1,y_1),T_2(x_2,y_2)$:\n",
    "        * $m = {{y_2 - y_1} \\over {x_2 - x_1}}$ - that is, for every 1 unit change in X, how many changed in y? \n",
    "        * You can then calculate $b$ by putting in the calculated $m$ and one point ($T_1$ or $T_2$)\n",
    "        \n",
    "* Nonlinear functions\n",
    "    * Has a variable gradient; every point can have a different one (ie. if you draw a line expressing the rate of change at any given point, it will be different to other points)\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given any point $p$ on a curve, you can choose points ever closer to it (on the left and the right) such that they approach $p$; they're at an *infinitesimal distance* from $p$\n",
    "* The limit of the function $f$ at $p$ is the value of $f$ at $p$; as you approach $p$, this value is the limit\n",
    "* For a function $f$, $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to a} f(x) = L$\n",
    "    * Values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily close to $L$ by requiring that $x$ be sufficiently close to, but not equal to, $a$\n",
    "* For simple examples, it's easy. For $f(x) = 2X + 3$, the limit as $x$ approaches $3$ is $9$.\n",
    "* For others, it's harder. for $f(x) = {{x^2}\\over{1 - x}}$, there is no value of $y$ for this function when $x = 1$. \n",
    "    * As $x$ tends towards $1$ from the left, the value of the function tends towards positive infinity; as the denominator gets smaller and smaller, and the numerator gets closer and closer to $1$, the ratio between them becomes infinitely large. \n",
    "    * Similarly, as $x$ approaches one from the right, the denominator tends closer towards an infinitely small *negative* number (because $x > 1$), and so the result of the function tends towards negative infinity.\n",
    "* So, for the first example we say that $f(x)$ was a 2-sided limit: as you approach the value from left or right, the value of the function tends towards the same value. \n",
    "    * The second example has both left hand and right hand limits, and they're different: ; ie. as you approach from these directions, they tend towards a different number.\n",
    "    * Right hand limit: $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = L$ - ie. we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we like by choosing  $x\\to{a}$ but greater than $a$.\n",
    "    * Left hand limit: $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = L$ - ie. we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we like by choosing $x\\to{a}$ but less than $a$.\n",
    "* You only get a two-sided limit if both limits exist, and are equal.\n",
    "* In python, you can use `SymPy.limit()` to calculate limits."
