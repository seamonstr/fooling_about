    "\n",
    "* Given any point $p$ on a curve, you can choose points ever closer to it (on the left and the right) such that they approach $p$; they're at an *infinitesimal distance* from $p$\n",
    "* The limit of the function $f$ at $p$ is the value of $f$ at $p$; as you approach $p$, this value is the limit\n",
    "* For a function $f$, $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to a} f(x) = L$\n",
    "    * Values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily close to $L$ by requiring that $x$ be sufficiently close to, but not equal to, $a$\n",
    "* For simple examples, it's easy. For $f(x) = 2X + 3$, the limit as $x$ approaches $3$ is $9$.\n",
    "* For others, it's harder. for $f(x) = {{x^2}\\over{1 - x}}$, there is no value of $y$ for this function when $x = 1$. \n",
    "    * As $x$ tends towards $1$ from the left, the value of the function tends towards positive infinity; as the denominator gets smaller and smaller, and the numerator gets closer and closer to $1$, the ratio between them becomes infinitely large. \n",
    "    * Similarly, as $x$ approaches one from the right, the denominator tends closer towards an infinitely small *negative* number (because $x > 1$), and so the result of the function tends towards negative infinity.\n",
    "* So, for the first example we say that $f(x)$ was a 2-sided limit: as you approach the value from left or right, the value of the function tends towards the same value. \n",
    "    * The second example has both left hand and right hand limits, and they're different: ; ie. as you approach from these directions, they tend towards a different number.\n",
    "    * Right hand limit: $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = L$ - ie. we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we like by choosing  $x\\to{a}$ but greater than $a$.\n",
    "    * Left hand limit: $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = L$ - ie. we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we like by choosing $x\\to{a}$ but less than $a$.\n",
    "* You only get a two-sided limit if both limits exist, and are equal.\n",
    "* In python, you can use `SymPy.limit()` to calculate limits.\n",

    "## Derivative function - $f'(x)$\n",
    "Given a non-linear function, you get a curve. The gradient of the curve at any given point is the gradient of the tangent to the curve at that point. This is the derivative; the slope of the line, or the instantanous rate of change.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for any function $f(x)$, the derivative of the function at point $x = a$ is denoted as $f'(a)$ (\"f-prime of $a$\"). This function is: \n",
    "$$\\lim\\limits_{h \\to 0 } {{f(a+h) - f(a)}\\over{h}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively: $f(a+h) - f(a)$ is the change in $y$; $h$ is the change in $x$ over the same distance. Assuming $h$ is small enough, you'll get a reasonable approximation of $f'(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this to a quadratic equation of $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ where $a = 2$, you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0} { {(2+h)^2 + 1 - 2^2 + 1} \\over {h} }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$= \\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0} { {4 + 4h + h^2 + 1 - 5} \\over {h} }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$= \\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0} { 4 + h }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "...and as $h \\to 0$, that gives a result of $4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Higher-order derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)$ tells us the value for $y$ of each $x$ - the position.\n",
    "$f'(x)$ tells us the instantaneous rate of change of $f(x)$ for any $x$ - ie. the velocity.\n",
    "$f''(x)$ tells us the rate of change of the rate of change - ie. how has the gradient changed at that $x$? ie. the accelleration\n",
    "$f'''(x)$ tells us how the accelleration is changing at $x$ - \"whoa, we're accellerating faster!\"; like a jerk."
